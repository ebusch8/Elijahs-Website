These are the files for my website. So far, it's just me working on this. I mostly code this. Credit to W3Schools and Codecademy for the tutorials. If you would like to join and help me with this, you are welcome to. If you can run a web server for me, I would love it.
I could use some help with JavaScript and CSS. Other Backend helps too.
