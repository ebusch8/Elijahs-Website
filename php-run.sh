php -S localhost:8081 -t index.php
# This script starts a PHP built-in web server on localhost at port 8081, serving files from the index.php directory.
# The -S option specifies the address and port to listen on, and the -t option specifies the document root.
# The server will serve files from the index.php directory, and you can access it by navigating to http://localhost:8081 in your web browser.
# The server will continue running until you stop it with Ctrl+C.
# The script is useful for testing and development purposes, allowing you to quickly set up a local server without needing to install a full web server like Apache or Nginx.
# The server is not intended for production use, as it is not as robust or secure as a full web server.
